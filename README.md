##Details for teaching team
I would have liked to implement an option for uppercase OR first letter of each word capitalized, but in the end I couldn't get it to work in time.

I used two stackoverflow message boards as learning sources to enable checkboxes and dropdowns to stay selected after submission. I think it's a pretty cool feature!
